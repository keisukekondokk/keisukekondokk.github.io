## About Me

I am a senior fellow of the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI) in Japan. My research interests span across a wide variety of empirical topics in spatial economics, such as agglomeration economies and diseconomies, spatial spillover effects, local labor markets, interregional labor migration, and international trade.
