## About Me

I am a senior fellow of the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI) and an associate professor (cross appointment) at the Research Institute for Economics and Business Administration (RIEB), Kobe University in Japan.

My research interests span across a wide variety of empirical topics in spatial economics, such as agglomeration economies and diseconomies, spatial spillover effects, local labor markets, interregional labor migration, and international trade.
